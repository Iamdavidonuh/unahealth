## Code challenge from Una Health

### If i had the time i would have done the following

- Written more comprehensive tests surround python commands, api endpoints. I sacrified tests so i could complete more given i already wasted time with the csv files
- Implement a download to csv, json and excel feature
- Added a proper readme to explain endpoints
